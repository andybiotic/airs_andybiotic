AIRS starts with simple cargo chains, and as time progresses, gradually more complex flows are added to create a semi-realistic economy.

As the map evolves, players will need to adapt their networks to to handle the changing demands brought on by concentrated production centres and ever-larger quantities of cargo.

Secondary Industry creation are important parts of AIRS. Costs for funding these industries are reduced significantly.

## Key Features:
- Simple cargo chains available initially.
- More complex flows available later.
- Players choose where to locate many secondary industries. Funding costs for these are very low.
- Boost primary industries later on with supply feedback loops.
- Development of the economy occurs in distinct stages.
- New industries including Container Port, Grain Elevator, Inland Container Terminal and Inland Grain Terminal.
- Farms are eyecandy only. Farms do not produce or accept cargo.

AIRS offers 3 economies, each based on a geographic region.

## Plains, Trains and Steel
Based on the praries of Canada and Northern USA. Grain farming and steelmaking dominate this economy.

## Black Gold and Fire
Inspired by the coal-rich region of South Wales, United Kingdom. 

## Trade and Waves
A generalised econonmy based on North West Europe.

_New industries and cargo flows occur at specific times. Please note, some industries have different introduction dates and cargo requirements in different economies._

### 1860 - Industrial Age
With the start of the Industrial Age in 1860, a large number of smaller industries are ready and waiting to be serviced. At this time, industry chains are basic and production quantities will be low. Servicing as many industries as possible here is the key to success.

### 1895 - Golden Age 
New metallurgy production processes allow the production of higher quality steel and associated products, culminating in the assembly of Vehicles.

### 1930 - Boom Age
Increased food production, fuel oils and other products make for some sophisticate supply chains.

### 1965 - Modern Age
Intermodal Goods are produced at multiple industries and accepted at even more. This dramatic shift revolutionises cargo transit and networks will be required to scale effectively. 

### 2000 - Information Age
Recycled materials offer new cargo flows.

## Gameplay tips:
- All primary industries should be present at start of the game. The rest of the chain won’t be available until a later age.
- Early in the game, it is easy to be profitable by serving a large number of relatively independent industries.
- In later stages, effectively managing the interconnected chains is important.

## FAQs

> **_Why do some industries accept cargoes that aren’t available?_**
> At the beginning of the game (1860 is the recommended start date), only a few basic chains are possible. As each Industry Age starts, industries and cargoes are added. By the final Age, all cargoes and industries will be available.
> 
> _**Towards the beginning, there doesn’t appear to be a way to increase the output of my mines and farms, is this a mistake?**_ 
> This is intentional. In the first age, you may need to connect many cottage industries to be profitable. In the later ages, production can be boosted with some new cargoes. You might then find it advantageous to rationalise your network and concentrate on a few production centres for maximum efficiency
> 
> **_Which vehicle sets can I use?_**
> Many newer vehicle sets are compatible. If it supports FIRS cargos, it will work. I recommend Iron Horse and NARS2.
> 
> _**Is there anyone you would like to thank?**_
> Yes. AndyTheNorth and everyone who worked on FIRS. Thank you for their hard work and excellent documentation, as this project would not be possible without these.
> 
> _**Is AIRS historically accurate?**_
> AIRS aims to mimic the evolution of simple industries as they mature into concentrated production centres and produce more technologically advanced cargoes. Playability is considered and some artistic licence is used, so this industry set isn’t wholly accurate from an historic point of view.
> 
> _**What is a Grain Elevator?**_
> Grain Elevators were once found across North America in towns and villages alongside railroad tracks. Farmers would deliver their grain where it would be weighed and stored before being loaded on to freight trains. This process still occurs today on a large scale at inland terminals. These two industries allow simulation of a scalable grain flow, without the hassle of servicing a very large number of small farms.
> 
> **_Intermodal Terminals both accept and produce Goods, are you crazy?_**
> Maybe a little. This is designed to simulate the import and export of containerised products from coastal and inland transhipment ports.
