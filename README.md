AIRS starts with simple cargo chains, and as time progresses, gradually more complex flows are added to create a semi-realistic economy.

As the map evolves, players will need to adapt their networks to to handle the changing demands brought on by concentrated production centres and ever-larger quantities of cargo.

Secondary Industry creation are important parts of AIRS. Costs for funding these industries are reduced significantly.

## Key Features:
- Simple cargo chains available initially.
- More complex flows available later.
- Players choose where to locate many secondary industries. Funding costs for these are very low.
- Boost primary industries later on with supply feedback loops.
- Development of the economy occurs in distinct stages.
- New industries including Container Port, Grain Elevator, Inland Container Terminal and Inland Grain Terminal.

This expansive economy is loosely based on Northern USA / Southern Canada. Plains, Trains and Steel includes industries spanning the fertile prairies, through the mineral rich mountains to the important coastal trading ports.

### 1860 - Industrial Age
With the start of the Industrial Age in 1860, a large number of smaller industries are ready and waiting to be serviced. At this time, industry chains are basic and production quantities will be low. Servicing as many industries as possible here is the key to success.

### 1895 - Golden Age 
New metallurgy production processes allow the manufacture of Carbon Steel and associated products, culminating in the assembly of Vehicles. Food production increases significantly with the mass-synthesis of fertilisers.

### 1930 - Boom Age
Oil dominates with the mass production of petroleum fuels and chemicals. New technologies spur huge increases in primary mining and food industries through the Engineering and Farm Supply feedback loop.

### 1965 - Modern Age
Intermodal Goods are produced at multiple industries and accepted at even more. This dramatic shift revolutionises cargo transit and large-scale Cement production adds a new cargo chain.

## Gameplay tips:
- All primary industries should be present at start of the game. The rest of the chain won’t be available until a later age.
- Early in the game, it is easy to be profitable by serving a large number of relatively independent industries.
- In later stages, effectively managing the interconnected chains is important.

## Scenario
An epic hand-crafted scenario is also provided alongside AIRS.


## Future Plans
- More updates to the new industry graphics
- Tweaks and enhancements to the economy
- Extra economies (long-term)
- Maybe a North American Building set? (long-term)


## FAQs

> **_Why do some industries accept cargoes that aren’t available?_**
> At the beginning of the game (1860 is the recommended start date), only a few basic chains are possible. As each Industry Age starts, industries and cargoes are added. By the final Age, all cargoes and industries will be available.
> 
> _**Towards the beginning, there doesn’t appear to be a way to increase the output of my mines and farms, is this a mistake?**_ 
> This is intentional. In the first age, you may need to connect many cottage industries to be profitable. In the later ages, production can be boosted with some new cargoes. You might then find it advantageous to rationalise your network and concentrate on a few production centres for maximum efficiency
> 
> **_Which vehicle sets can I use?_**
> Many newer vehicle sets are compatible. If it supports FIRS cargos, it will work. I recommend NARS2.
> 
> _**Is there anyone you would like to thank?**_
> Yes. AndyTheNorth and everyone who worked on FIRS. Thank you for their hard work and excellent documentation, as this project would not be possible without these.
> 
> _**Is AIRS historically accurate?**_
> AIRS aims to mimic the evolution of simple industries as they mature into concentrated production centres and produce more technologically advanced cargoes. Playability is considered and some artistic licence is used, so this industry set isn’t wholly accurate from an historic point of view.
> 
> _**What is a Grain Elevator?**_
> Grain Elevators were once found across North America in towns and villages alongside railroad tracks. Farmers would deliver their grain where it would be weighed and stored before being loaded on to freight trains. This process still occurs today on a large scale at inland terminals. These two industries allow simulation of a scalable grain flow, without the hassle of servicing a very large number of small farms.
> 
> **_Intermodal Terminals both accept and produce Goods, are you crazy?_**
> Maybe a little. This is designed to simulate the import and export of containerised products from coastal and inland transhipment ports.
